"[11] [Adjustment] | No data on surface water and groundwater available, only total IRWR figure of 2.8 km3/yr. Figures filled in based on discussion with Jean Margat."
"[12] [Components] | Sumatra 85.8 + Java 25.6 + Bali and Nusa Tenggara 1.5 + Kalimantan 125.1 + Sulawesi 16.6 + Maluku 5.9 + Papua 196.9"
"[13] [Components] | From Saudi Arabia 0.08 (groundwater from Umm er Radhuma)"
"[14] [Components] | From the Syrian Arab Republic (into Dan spring) 0.25; from West Bank 0.325; from Lebanon 0.150 (Hulah Lake)"
"[15] [Adjustment] | Average, calculated based on 0.283 from M.Bilbeisi (1992), 0.474 (0.418-0.530) from Shlami Dinar (NATO 2004), 0.456 from Annual Environment Statistics (1997), and 0.437 from Al Kwaldeh(1997)."
"[16] [Components] | Natural inflow from Saudi Arabia from Disi aquifer 0.18; Inflow from Syria 0.09"
"[17] [Observations] | 626 groundwater fields explored with total reserves of 15.93 km3/year; reserves with salinity rate up to 1 g/l are 33.85 km3/year; reserves with salinity rate up to 10 g/l are 57.63 km3/year (Ref: UNDP. 2004. Water resources of Kazakhstan in the new millenium). In 1993, the part of groundwater resources which could be extracted from existing pumping facilities was estimated at 6.1 km3/year."
"[18] [Components] | This is groundwater coming from Saudi Arabia, but it is mostly brackish."
"[19] [Components] | Amu Darya 0.23; Syr Darya 5.25; Southeastern (Tarim) 1.76; Chu 3.60; Talas and Assa 0.83; Lake Issyk-Kul 2.02."
"[20] [Observations] | Assuming recharge rate of 0.1 m/yr over 300 km2"
"[21] [Overall accuracy] | According to the national source, 1/3 of the 60 km3/yr total IRWR is groundwater, which is thus 20 km3/yr."
"[22] [Observations] | Natural theoretical groundwater resources (GW recharge)."
"[23] [Adjustment] | National source states  Internal GW flow = 92.6 km3/yr, but this doesn't include overlap, and does include incidental recharge (which AQUASTAT does not consider natural)."
"[24] [Observations] | 10% of surface water"
"[25] [Components] | From Israel to Gaza Strip"
"[26] [Overall accuracy] | Other sources give 50 or 61."
"[27] [Overall accuracy] | Unknown but very close to overlap"
"[28] [Observations] | Base flow WRI"
"[29] [Components] | From Saudi Arabia"
"[30] [Components] | From Bulgaria"
"[31] [Adjustment] | 1.0 recharges the ""usable"" aquifers."
"[32] [Adjustment] | From PNUD/Ministere de l'hydraulique. 1994. Upper aquifer 1.5-2, intermediate aquifer 1-1.5, deep aquifer 0.5, total 3-4 ->took average of 3.5"
"[33] [Components] | 0.545 Trinidad, 0.069 Tobago"
"[34] [Adjustment] | Difference between TIRWR (1.405. Ref: ""CA-water. Aral sea basin. http://www.cawater-info.net/aral/water_e.htm."") and IRSWR"
"[35] [Methodology] | Considered to be 10 percent of the precipitation."
"[36] [Methodology] | Difference between groundwater (227) and overlap (204.7) is what is given by MPPA (Ministerio del Poder Popular para el Ambiente) as renewable groundwater (22.3)."
